# Azure API Management Workshop @ APIStrat 2016

Thanks for attending Azure API Management (__APIM__) workshop at APIStrat 2016. In this workshop, we will start with giving you a brief overview of APIM. Then we will demonstrate the key features and capabilities of the product â€“ policies and expressions, built-in and custom analytics, configuration over Git, portal customization and more.

If you have any questions during the workshop, please let us know at any time! 

# Prerequisite
To follow along you need to provision your own instance of APIM and have it ready by the start of the session. See https://aka.ms/createapim for directions.
